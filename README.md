## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- Create html layout (head, body,script)
- Start off as make them green homework but add 6 more boxes
- Create a function so that every alternate click is different colour
- Add variables tied to their corresponding colour to record their position
- Add array for positions that makes the user win
- Use conditions to compare user inputs to pre-recorded positions for win condition
- Add win message
- Tidy html then add css to it
